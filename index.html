					<p> "Let's Go Paint!" is a side-scrolling adventure game about depression, social anxiety, and imagination. Meet strange characters and challenge your inner thoughts as you walk across campus to go paint. </p>

					<p> I coded the game in javascript, drew all the backgrounds, and wrote the story. You can play it right in your browser at <a href = "http://www.letsgopaint.net"> letsgopaint.net </a>.  </p>

					<p> Please send any questions and comments about the game to me at vaasu@letsgopaint.net</p>

			<h2> Text-Based Deep Learning for Artificial Jazz Improvisation</h2>
			<div class = "singleBox">
				<div class = "boxText">
					<p> Using recurrent neural networks, my teammates and I attempted to artificially create jazz-like improvisations. </p>
					<p>We provide an RNN using torch-rnn, trained on freely available MIDI files of jazz transcriptions, which can generate music that captures rhythms, and to a lesser extend harmony and melody. We also provide a new ASCII-based file format capable of storing music in a compact but not totally opaque way. Our format allows for close to a 7-times size decrease from existing MIDI-to-CSV converters. We show the musical principles behind the information we chose to include and leave out in converting MIDI to our new format. </p>
					<p> You can read our paper <a href = "http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~vtaneja/jazzpaper.pdf"> here </a> and listen to an example generated audio sample <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46gpwB9Jc5I"> here </a>.

					<p> The Lamppost Project is an interactive single webpage art project based around lampposts. I coded the front end in javascript and built the back end using Node.js, Amazon S3, and mlab for file storage. </p>
					<p> You can view the web app <a href = "https://lamppost-project.herokuapp.com/"> here </a>. Feel free to submit your own pictures of lampposts to the page if you see any cool ones! </p>

			<h2> Local Egg Website (not in use) </h2>
			<div class = "singleBox">
				<div class = "boxText">
					<p> A website I made for a local non-profit. I coded the frontend of the webpage to closely match the design guidelines that they gave me. I utilized Sendgrid's API to send users' response forms on the contact and apply pages as formatted emails to the non-profit. </p> 

					<p> You can view the website <a href = "https://localegg.herokuapp.com/"> here </a> </p>

			<h2> Simple Chess Clock </h2>
			<div class = "singleBox">
				<div class = "boxText">
					<p> A practical web app for chess players who don't have a chess clock with them. Set the interval and how much time to start with, and start playing. </p>
					<p> As you can guess, I made this because one time I didn't have my chess clock with me when I wanted to play blitz chess :) </p>
					<p>The chess clock is available <a href = "https://vaasut.github.io/chessclock/"> here </a> </p>

			<h2> Seismic Decimation </h2>
			<div class = "singleBox">
				<div class = "boxText">
					<p> Decimation.py reads in an mseed file, decimates the sampling rate by the given decimation_factor and outputs the original data and the decimated data to a new output file. It may also plot a spectrogram of the waveform. </p>

					<p> Learn more about the app <a href = "https://github.com/vaasut/seismicdecimation"> here </a> </p>

					<p> Decimation.py uses the <a href = "https://github.com/obspy/obspy/"> ObsPy </a> framework. </p>
